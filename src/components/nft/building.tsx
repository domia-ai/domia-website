					Unlike most NFT projects, Domia isnâ€™t built around hype. Itâ€™s built
					around purpose. Weâ€™re using this collection to fund the development of
					open-source local AI infrastructure, emotional cognition modules,
					real-world integrations, and tools for the community. Your support
					helps us keep Domia ethical, local, and independent â€” without needing
					cloud APIs or venture capital strings. This is how we fund the future:
					with those who believe in it.
