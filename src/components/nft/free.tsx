					For our first 3,000 NFTs, weâ€™re doing something bold: no
					subscriptions, no monthly fees, no centralized paywalls. You mint a
					Domia, and itâ€™s fully yours â€” personality, memory, voice, and updates
					included. This model is only for early supporters. It helps us fund
					development while rewarding those who believe in local-first AI before
					anyone else. Future activations may require different models â€” but
					these first 3,000 Domiaâ€™s are permanently yours, no strings attached.
