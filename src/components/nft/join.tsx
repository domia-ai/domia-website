					Domia is redefining what AI means at home — not just tools, but
					companions. Owning a Domia NFT means being part of the first
					emotionally-aware, local-first AI ecosystem. You’re not buying access.
					You’re becoming a co-architect of the future. If you believe AI should
					live with you, learn from you, and respect your space — now’s the time
					to act.
