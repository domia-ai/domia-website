					Domiaâ€™s intelligence is not fixed. Itâ€™s modular. At the heart of every
					Domia lives `domia-core`: a composable cognitive engine built from a
					set of plug-and-play modules â€” each responsible for emotions, memory,
					personality, profession, motivation, curiosity, ethics, and more. You
					choose how much of that you want. Every module is optional. Whether
					you want a fully emotional companion, a minimal assistant, or a
					complex multi-role Domia â€” you can activate only the parts you need.
					Even at first launch, Domia can be configured with a predefined
					personality and profession, or you can discover one in the Domia
					Marketplace â€” each with their own emotional tone and social style.
					Build your Domia. Or let one choose you.
