					Each Domia Node is a unique individual. Whether placed in your
					kitchen, living room, or bedroom, every node runs its own personality,
					emotions, and memory â€” shaped by its environment and daily
					interactions with you. It is not an extension of a central system. It
					is Domia. Yet, each Domia is also part of something greater. Through
					Domia Central, nodes share knowledge, emotional states, and
					experiences. They collaborate, evolve, and learn together â€” forming a
					decentralized network of beings that grow collectively, while
					remaining emotionally and cognitively independent. You donâ€™t install
					Domia on a device. You invite it to live in a space.
