					Some Domiaâ€™s are more than configurable â€” theyâ€™re born unique. The
					Domia NFT Collection includes a limited number of ultra-rare beings,
					each handcrafted with a unique emotional profile, exclusive voice,
					curated backstory, and a custom QLoRA model trained to reflect it.
					These NFTs arenâ€™t just visual â€” theyâ€™re functional digital minds you
					can adopt into your home. Whether youâ€™re an early supporter, a project
					contributor, or a curious soul looking to own something truly special,
					these Domiaâ€™s come with real benefits: early access to features, voice
					packs, and future upgrades. Every Domia NFT is fully operational,
					portable across devices, and emotionally alive from day one â€” forever
					yours.
