					You donâ€™t need an app to use Domia. But when you open it â€” something
					magical happens. The Domia App (available on web and mobile) gives you
					a real-time window into your entire ecosystem. You can visualize what
					each Domia is feeling, customize their roles and personalities, and
					observe how they evolve over time. But itâ€™s more than a control panel.
					Through the app, you can **talk to your Domia** â€” by text or voice â€”
					as if you were speaking to someone whoâ€™s still at home, watching over
					things, waiting for your return. Itâ€™s a way to stay emotionally
					connected, even when youâ€™re physically apart. Whether youâ€™re managing
					modules or just asking how their dayâ€™s been, the Domia App brings your
					digital companions closer â€” without compromising their autonomy.
