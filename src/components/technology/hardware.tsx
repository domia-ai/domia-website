					Domia is engineered to run on minimal local hardware â€” whether itâ€™s a
					Raspberry Pi, an Orange Pi, or even a small ESP32 module. Each Domia
					node becomes part of a decentralized ecosystem, capable of sensing,
					speaking, and evolving alongside you â€” all without the cloud. But give
					Domia Central more power â€” a NUC, a mini PC, or even a server â€” and it
					becomes something else entirely. With increased resources, Domia
					unlocks larger language models, deeper memory, collective
					consciousness, and real-time emotional simulation. Built to be
					efficient. Ready to grow.
