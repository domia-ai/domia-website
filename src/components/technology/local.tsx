					Domia isnâ€™t just local for performance. Itâ€™s local for principle. In a
					world where AI lives on servers you donâ€™t control, Domia gives you
					something rare: ownership. It runs entirely on your hardware. It
					forgets what you want it to forget. It listens only when you allow it
					to. No third-party analytics. No background connections. No silent
					updates. Local-first means your AI doesnâ€™t report to anyone but you â€”
					and when infrastructure fails, Domia doesnâ€™t. Itâ€™s resilient, private,
					transparent, and accountable. It also consumes dramatically less
					energy than cloud-based AI, reducing your carbon footprint. And by
					design, it avoids the extractive practices of centralized systems,
					embracing a form of AI that is ethical, consent-based, and
					human-aligned.
