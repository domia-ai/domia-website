					To create your own Domia, you begin by designing its personality:
					define its emotional tone, profession, voice, and behaviors. From
					there, you generate a dataset â€” questions, answers, interactions, and
					edge cases â€” that reflect how this Domia should think and feel. With
					that, a custom QLoRA module is trained locally or in a secure
					environment, ready to be embedded into a node. The result? A living
					Domia thatâ€™s truly yours.
