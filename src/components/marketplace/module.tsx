					Under the hood of every Domia is a compact, local QLoRA model â€”
					uniquely trained on its profession, emotional range, and behavior
					patterns. When you install a Domia, youâ€™re not just loading settings.
					Youâ€™re activating a mini-brain designed to think, feel, and respond
					like no other.
